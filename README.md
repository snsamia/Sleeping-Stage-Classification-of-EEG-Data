# Sleeping-Stage-Classification-of-EEG-Data
leep Stage Classification from EEG: Used MNE to preprocess PhysioNet EEG data and extracted relative spectral power features from standard EEG bands. Built a Random Forest classifier and benchmarked it with Logistic Regression, SVM, and Gradient Boosting using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation, achieving up to 93% accuracy.
